# Code2flow
 >" 72% of developers believe visual representations improve debugging efficiency. (Stack Overflow Survey)"

## Overview


Code2Flow is an intuitive online tool that converts **Python, C, and Java** code into interactive flowcharts, making it easier to visualize complex logic structures. Designed for developers, students, and educators, it simplifies code comprehension and debugging by transforming raw code into **clear, structured diagrams**. Built using React.js, Mermaid.js, and Material UI, it provides real-time flowchart generation with **dark mode** support and the ability to download diagrams as PNGs. Whether for learning, teaching, or documentation, Code2Flow enhances understanding and efficiency. Future improvements include AI-powered optimizations and expanded language support for a more robust coding experience. ðŸš€



## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Understanding complex logic flows in programming can be challenging. Traditional debugging and analysis methods are time-consuming and inefficient. Code2Flow simplifies this by automatically generating clear, visual flowcharts from your code, making it easier to analyze, debug, and document logic structures.
