# Code2Flow 

 >" 72% of developers believe visual representations improve debugging efficiency. (Stack Overflow Survey)"

## Description


 

Code2Flow is an innovative online tool designed to convert Python, C++ and Java code into interactive flowcharts and structured pseudocode. It simplifies complex code logic by visually representing loops, conditions, and function calls, making it easier for developers, students, and educators to understand and analyze program flow.  


## Problem Statement

Understanding complex logic flows in programming can be challenging. Traditional debugging and analysis methods are time-consuming and inefficient. Code2Flow simplifies this by automatically generating clear, visual flowcharts from your code, making it easier to analyze, debug, and document logic structures.

## Working 


 

Code2Flow takes Python, C, or Java code as input and dynamically converts it into a flowchart and structured pseudocode The frontend, built with *React.js*, processes the code, extracts logical structures like *loops, conditionals, and functions*, and passes them to *Mermaid.js* for real-time flowchart generation. A *custom algorithm* generates well-structured pseudocode alongside the flowchart.  

Users can switch between light/dark modes, download flowcharts as PNGs, and copy pseudocode for documentation or learning purposes. This tool enhances debugging, learning, and technical documentation, making complex algorithms easier to visualize and understand. Future improvements include AI-powered code analysis and expanded language support. 🚀

## Features ♻️
 

1. *Multi-Language Support*
Code2Flow supports three major programming languages: Python, C++, and Java. This makes it a versatile tool for developers, students, and educators working with different coding paradigms. Whether you're analyzing an object-oriented Java program or a procedural C++ script, Code2Flow efficiently visualizes the logic structure.  

2. *Interactive Flowchart Generation*  
The tool dynamically converts code into interactive flowcharts, helping users visualize the execution flow. By highlighting loops, conditions, and function calls, it makes complex logic easier to understand and debug. The real-time generation ensures instant feedback, improving efficiency and comprehension.  

3. *Automatic Pseudocode Conversion* 
Alongside flowcharts, Code2Flow also generates structured pseudocode from the input program. This feature is particularly beneficial for students and educators, as it provides a simplified representation of the code logic, bridging the gap between human-readable explanations and actual programming syntax.  

4. *Dark Mode & User-Friendly UI*  
With dark mode support, users can switch between themes for better readability. The interface is designed for ease of use, ensuring smooth navigation, syntax highlighting, and seamless interaction with generated flowcharts and pseudocode.  

5. *Downloadable Flowcharts*  
Users can download flowcharts as PNG images, making including them in reports, technical documentation, and educational materials easier. This helps visually present code logic in classrooms, coding tutorials, and software development teams.  

6. *Future Enhancements*  
Planned updates include AI-powered code analysis multi-language expansion, and customizable flowcharts with interactive editing features. These enhancements will make Code2Flow even more powerful and adaptable for various coding needs. 🚀
